This tutorial is built on the [GetStartedWithData app][GitHub], which is an Android app. The UI for this app is identical to the app generated by the Mobile Services Android quickstart, except that added items are stored locally in memory. You will add the code needed to persist the data to storage.


1. Download the `GetStartedWithData` sample app and expand the files on your computer. 

2. In Eclipse, click **File** then **Import**, expand **Android**, click **Existing Android Code into Workspace**, and then click **Next.**

3. Click **Browse**, browse to the location of the expanded project files, click **OK**, and make sure that the TodoActivity project is checked. If you want the project copied into your workspace, check the **Copy projects into workspace** box. Finally, click **Finish**.

	This imports the project files into the current workspace.
