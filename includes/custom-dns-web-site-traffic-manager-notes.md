If you do not already have a Traffic Manager profile, use the information in [Create a Traffic Manager profile using Quick Create](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/dn339012.aspx) to create one. Note the **.trafficmanager.net** domain name associated with your Traffic Manager profile, as this will be used later by later steps in this document.
