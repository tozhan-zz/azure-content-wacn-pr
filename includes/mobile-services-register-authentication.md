To be able to authenticate users, you must register your app with an identity provider. You must then register the provider-generated client secret with Mobile Services.

1. Log on to the [Azure Management Portal], click **Mobile Services**, and then click your mobile service.

2. Click the **Dashboard** tab and make a note of the **Mobile Service URL** value.

    You may need to provide this value to the identity provider when you register your app.

3. Choose a supported identity provider from the list below and follow the steps to register your app with that provider:

 - <a href="/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-how-to-register-microsoft-authentication/" target="_blank">Microsoft Account</a>
 - <a href="/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-how-to-register-facebook-authentication/" target="_blank">Facebook login</a>
 - <a href="/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-how-to-register-twitter-authentication/" target="_blank">Twitter login</a>
 - <a href="/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-how-to-register-google-authentication/" target="_blank">Google login</a>
 - <a href="/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-how-to-register-active-directory-authentication/" target="_blank">Azure Active Directory</a>


    Remember to make a note of the client identity and secret values generated by the provider.

    <div class="dev-callout"><b>Security Note</b>
	<p>The provider-generated secret is an important security credential. Do not share this secret with anyone or distribute it with your app.</p>
    </div>

4. Back in the Management Portal, click the **Identity** tab, enter the app identifier and shared secret values obtained from your identity provider, and click **Save**.

	Both your mobile service and your app are now configured to work with your chosen authentication provider.
