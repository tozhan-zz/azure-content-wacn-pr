1. Open the project file QSTodoListViewController.m and in the **viewDidLoad** method, remove the following code that reloads the data into the table:

        [self refresh];

2.	Just after the **viewDidLoad** method, add the following code:  

        - (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated
        {
            MSClient *client = self.todoService.client;
            
            if (client.currentUser != nil) {
                return;
            }
            
            [client loginWithProvider:@"facebook" controller:self animated:YES completion:^(MSUser *user, NSError *error) {
                [self refresh];
            }];
        }

    <div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
	<p>If you are using an identity provider other than Facebook, change the value passed to <strong>loginWithProvider</strong> above to one of the following: <em>microsoftaccount</em>, <em>facebook</em>, <em>twitter</em>, <em>google</em>, or <em>windowsazureactivedirectory</em>.</p>
    </div>
		
3. Press the **Run** button to build the project, start the app in the iPhone emulator, then log-on with your chosen identity provider.

   	When you are successfully logged-in, the app should run without errors, and you should be able to query Mobile Services and make updates to data.
