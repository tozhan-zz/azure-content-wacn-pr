Setting a custom domain name on a web site that is load balanced by Traffic Manager is only available for Standard mode web sites. Before switching a web site from the Free web site mode to the Shared, Basic or Standard mode, you must first remove spending caps in place for your Web Site subscription. 

For more information on the Web Site modes modes, including how to change the mode of your site, see [How to scale web sites](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-scale/).
